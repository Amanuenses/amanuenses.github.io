	<p><i>2018 Tenorio-Fornés, A., Jacynycz, V., Llop, D., Sánchez-Ruiz, A.A., Hassan, S. “A Decentralized Publication System for Open Science using Blockchain and IPFS”. PEERE International Conference on Peer Review Proceedings. Rome (2018)</i></p>
	<p>Science publication and peer review raises concerns about fairness, quality, performance, cost or accuracy. The Open Access movements has been unable to fulfill all its
promises, and middlemen publishers can still impose policies and concentrate profits. This
paper, using emerging distributed technologies such as Blockchain and IPFS, proposes a
decentralized publication system for open science. It provides transparent governance, a
distributed reviewer reputation system, and open access by-design. The paper concludes
reviewing the open challenges of such approach.</p>
